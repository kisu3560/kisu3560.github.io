    <section id="Page1">
        <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>html to html lang="eng". At the top of the page I made this change becasuse I normally write it like that.</li>
            <li>Added missing closings. line 22, 28, and 34 had no closing tags, so I added them, without it would be an error.</li>
            <li>Changed the source for the image. The image was missing part of the scource tag so I added img/ in front to define where the image is.</li>
            <li>Closed the table and the last row of cells. The last row of the table wasn't closed nor was the table, so I added the closers.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="Page2">
        <h2>Page 2</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>Added closing tag to line 25. "New Beehive Inn" was supposed to be bolded, but there was no indication on where the bold text ended.</li>
            <li>Fixed header values/levels for headings. Not all of the headers matched, so I changed them all to the appropriate size based on the Wikipedia article.</li>
            <li>Fixed links to have an actual link on lines 39 and 55. The links that were there linked to nothing, so I changed it to the same link used in the Wikipedia article.</li>
            <li>Added closing tag on line 72. Line 72 was missing a closing tag, so I put one in.</li>
            <li>A stylistic line was missing after line 100. Based on the Wikipedia article, there should have been an hr after line 100, so I added it.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="Page3">
        <h2>Page 3</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>The contents of the head was missing. To fix this, I typed "! enter" and filled out the general information of the page and deleted what I didn't need. These first few lines of code I include in all of my html files.</li>
            <li>I added a link to the stylesheet. There was a CSS stylesheet that goes along with this page, so I added a link to the page so the stylistic changes would be applied.</li>
            <li>Though it wasn't required, I fixed one thing in the stylesheet. The bottom copyright bar (the footer) was floating in the wrong place, so I changed its style to be locked at the bottom of the page instead of the bottom of the screen.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="Page4">
        <h2>Page 4</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>DOCTYPE html was missing. I added this first line because it defines the code as html.</li>
            <li>The title of the page was wrong. I changed the title of the page from "Page 4" to "Mid-term Page 4" to match the other pages.</li>
            <li>The table headers and pictures did not match. I decided to add the table headers to the left (or the first item in each row) since I thought it would be easier than rearranging all of the pictures.</li>
            <li>orangeCat.png and creature.png were missing tags. By adding the tags, the table lined up. Without them, it was wonky.</li>
            <li>I added alt text to every image. No alt text would be a violation of W3C validation, so I added one for each picture, making them as stupid as I could - because why not? The purpose of them is if the image doesn't load, this text would come up instead.</li>
        </ul>
