                                Calla Lily is the eldest "child" at 6 years old. Nicknamed Lily, she is our beautiful dilute torbieshell (that's a tortoiseshell-tabby). She has a luxurious and soft mostly gray coat. She is a 14.5lb fat (sorry, Lily) ball of hissing rage and laziness (so sorry, Lily). Lily seemingly hates everyone except for me - she only tolerates me.

                                Honeycomb is my boyfriend's 3 year old brown tabby (even though she is mostly gray in my opinion). She got her name from my boyfriend's love of bees. Because she was likely the runt of the litter, she is permanently the size of a teenage cat. In other words, she is tiny! This tiny gal is very friendly and playful, but also loves to fight; although she may see it as a fight to the death, we see it as a play fight. She's so cute, she won 4th place in the Cutest Cat in NoCo competition.

                                Katsuki is not only the only dog in our household, he is my only son! Even though he is just 2 years old, he is also the largest by far. He is a Shiba Inu/Chow Chow mix; however, we do not know for sure since he is a rescue. He is named after an anime character from <a href="https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/My_Hero_Academia_Wiki">My Hero Academia</a>. Aside from being the sweetest, cutest good boi you've ever met, like his name suggests, he is blonde and insanely explosive (<a href="https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Katsuki_Bakugo">if you know the character, you would agree</a>).

                                Also unlike his sisters, he was adopted from the <a href="https://animalshelter.adcogov.org/adoption-process">Riverdale Animal Shelter</a> in Adams County, CO.
