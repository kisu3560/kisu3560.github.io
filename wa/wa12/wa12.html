        I decided to make a random inspirational poster generator. I thought it would be funny. I find many inspirational quote posters don't have anything to do with the picture. so I made this. Not only did i change the API, I also added an API for the pictures and set them to both come up randomly when the botton is pressed. Of course I fixed the CSS too.
